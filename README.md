# Build and Run

- Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

- Run

```
yarn run dev
```

- Run Unity Server

To enter on the "metaverse Hub" you need to start a Unity server.

Go to the 'UnityServerBuilds' directory, choose your OS system and execute the .exe (Windows).

⚠️ For the MacOS, you'll probabily need to build the app from the .xcodeproj, more info at:
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/macos-building.html and https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/featuredarticles/XcodeConcepts/Concept-Projects.html
